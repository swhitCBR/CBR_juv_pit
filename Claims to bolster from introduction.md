# Introduction

Paragraph 1
- *The basin is also home to multiple evolutionarily distinct Pacific salmon and steelhead populations (Oncorhynchus spp.), **twelve of which have been listed as threatened or endangered since the 1990s**, with the **construction of dams cited as a major factor contributing to their declines***

- **Claim**
	- What 12 populations have been listed and when?
	- Where is the the threat posed by dams described?



Paragraph 2

- ***Salmon and steelhead populations continued to show signs of decline after JBSs were installed** at many of the dams and over time **concerns about the effectiveness of bypass and transportation began to mount**, ultimately leading to a **shift in conservation strategy and management policy focused on discouraging smolts from passing dams via powerhouse routes** in favor of surface outlets and spillways (NMFS 2008; NMFS 2020; Skalski et al. 2021)*

- **Claim**
	- What references describe:
		- continued declines following JBS placements?
		- explicitly talk about shift away from bypass systems (Budy paper?)?
	- Are providedthese references sufficient?


- *The Corner Collector (BCC) is a permanent surface outflow structure that was installed at Bonneville Dam in 2001 and equipped with an antenna array in 2007*
- **Claim**
	- Are these dates correct?


*There is substantial evidence that management actions have been effective in promoting smolt passage via non-powerhouse routes*
- **Claim**
	- What evidence is this based on 
	- Harnish et al. (2021?)


*An antenna array was put into operation on a spillway weir at Lower Granite Dam in 2019 that was successful in bolstering detection counts at the upstream end of the FCRPS and was expected to compensate for lower detection rates elsewhere.*
- **Claim**
	- What support is there for this claim?
		- Report produced by Rich?

*analysts from multiple organizations have reported that sparse detection data in recent years have made it difficult or impossible to estimate survival for release groups of interest, sometimes necessitating pooling sets of tags that would otherwise be analyzed separately (e.g., different rear types, hatcheries, sub-basins)*
- **Claim**
	- What support is there for this claim?
		- Report produced by Rich?

*for five consecutive years they have reported difficulty obtaining estimates using longstanding methods (Widener 2021; 2024; 2025).*
- **Claim**
	- Is this supported by the Reports here cited?



# Methods

"Similarly, tags detected at MCN were used to estimate survival between MCN and BON, with all detections downstream of BON pooled in the final sampling occasion."
- **Claim**
	- Were all downstream detections pooled?

# description of dams and such

We compiled detection records from lowest three dams in the Snake River include Lower Granite Dam (LGR), which is the first major interrogation site that outmigrating smolts encounter, followed by Little Goose Dam (LGS), and then Lower Monumental Dam (LMN; Figure 2). Below the confluence with the Upper Columbia River, fish encounter McNary Dam (MCN), followed by Ice Harbor (IHR), John Day (JDA), The Dalles (TDA), and Bonneville (BON) dams.




which is the first major interrogation site that outmigrating smolts encounter, followed by Little Goose Dam (LGS), and then Lower Monumental Dam (LMN; Figure 2). Below the confluence with the Upper Columbia River, fish encounter McNary Dam (MCN), followed by Ice Harbor (IHR), John Day (JDA), The Dalles (TDA), and Bonneville (BON) dams.

All of these dams with the exception of TDA are equipped with systems capable of detecting outmigrating juvenile salmon. Estuary detection systems are located approximately 230km downstream of Bonneville and are comprised of stationary pile dike antennas and a mobile array that is operated as a trawl.

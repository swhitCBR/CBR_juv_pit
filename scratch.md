"Tags with an unknown rear type or showing evidence of recapture or transport following release were removed"




- Consider testing out alternate bin definitions for temporal bins larger than 1 day
- Text describing this can be added aftewards
	- "This process resulted in temporal bins that extended beyond the end of the arrival distribution for all but the day category. We used the quality of the estimates from the different bin sizes to identify the minimum bin size for a given year and population (Figure 3)."



- Chunk of writing to add
estimates of juvenile survival have been produced by the National Marine Fisheries service
In some cases, data limitations have compelled analysts to make compromises including pooling tag histories across rear types, increasing the size of temporal strata. In addition, the low number of detections in the estuary has led to increased reliance on tag recoveries at avian colonies, a practice that entails additional assumptions and more complicated estimation methods (Widener et al. 2025).


Year of release does not fully determine the year of migration, so it was necessary to identify.


- In order to wrap up the historic trends manuscript Steve must
	- Get up-to-date detection information and have 2025 data added in
	- Finish write-up of sparsity metric description
	- Get estimates for sockeye salmon too
	- Finish write-up of sparsity metric description


- Interesting questions that this paper may or may not address
	- Can say “were it not for detections at _______” this would be x amount worse or we would not be able to obtain this or that
	- How valuable were the detections from the experimental systems used in the estuary since 2020?

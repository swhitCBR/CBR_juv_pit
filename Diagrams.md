# Towards understanding why particular missing cells present information

- (from legal pad notes)
- Algorithm for evaluating monitoring capacity
	- $E_1=$ at least 1
	- $E_{all}=$ nothing can be estimated

	- cell probabilities and frequencies 
		- Matrix of capture histories $\bf{CH}$
		- $\pi_{10}$,$\pi_{01}$,$\pi_{11}$
		- $n_{10}$,$n_{01}$,$n_{11}$
	- m-array formulation

## Lebreton et al. 1992
- Table 3 has branching diagram with column showing expected numbers on occasion 3
- captureh history counts represented as $X_{100}$ $X_{110}$ ...,
	- consider matrix version $\bf{X}$
## Burnham et al. 1987 (pg 31)
- Matrix of capture histories $\bf{CH}$
- $\phi_i=$ Survival rate
- $S=$Effect of survival rate in a study with treatment and control subjects
	- $S=\psi_{t1}/\psi_{c1}$

What does Steve Smith TIR refer to?

- CSS or Compass sources may have been missed
- 

2024 CSS report review comments
- "TDG to do CSS pull down for that"
- They use 4 cohorts per year
	- no release size given
- Only survival is {undecipherable}
- adjusted ordinal day water travel time used
- Also use "water travel time"
- Regression model with mixed effects and computing predicted survival at the average ordial day and travel time 
- they adjust for ocean survival in a few ways


- We could gather
	- PITPH
	- Survival
	- Travel Time measure
- RAB also says that they assess predictions under the preferred alternative, while adjusting for some covariantes
- They also do testing of differences of  "PITPH eras" rather than point estimates going in a particular direction
- 
RAB:
Resources folder in "data"directory FPC and CSS in there

Add csv that we have the NOAA reports too

2002-2006
2007-2019 (2017?)
2020-2024 juvenile survival up to 2024

"flexible" then "gas cap"

less flexible now b/c it occurs 24 hours
